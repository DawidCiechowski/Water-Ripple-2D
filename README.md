## Introduction

An algorithm based on the notion of creating pseudo water dropplets ripple effect on 2D screen via creation of two two-dimensional arrays, where one holds the current state of the pixels, and the other one holds the previous state of the pixels. Each frame, current buffer is being updated, and the prvious buffer is displayed, with dumping effect (float value) being applied as a force. At the end of each frame, the buffers or arrays, are swapped.

## How to use

1. Download Processing IDE onto your system.
2. Fork this repository onto the directory within your system.
3. Open the directory, containg the file in your Processing IDE.
4. Press the start button at the rop-right corner of Processing IDE to execute the file.

### Play around with it

1. Change the damping value to see how it will affect the ripple effect.
2. Change the size of the arrays. 3
3. Change the color of each pixel, whenever the mouse is clicked.
